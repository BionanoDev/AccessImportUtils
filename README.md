# Overview
*compressDeNovoAssembly_forImport.sh* is a tool for compressing a Bionano de novo assembly output, and importing to IrysView and Bionano Access. "compressDeNovoAssembly_forImport.pdf" provides instructions for how to compress the results of the Bionano Genomics IrysSolve pipeline for de novo assembly.

*compressHybridScaffold_forIrysViewImport.sh* is a tool for compressing a Bionano hybrid scaffold output generated by hybrid scaffold function through IrysView. The purpose of this tool is to facilitate the import of the IrysView hybrid scaffold (1 enzyme hybrid scaffold with automatic cut only) output into IrysView for visual display.

*compressHybridScaffold_forAccessImport.sh* is a tool for compressing a Bionano hybrid scaffold output generated by hybrid scaffold function through IrysView. The purpose of this tool is to facilitate the import of the IrysView hybrid scaffold output into the Bionano Access for visual display. It supports both automatic and manual run of hybrid scaffold output.
