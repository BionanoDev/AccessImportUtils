# Introduction
compressDeNovoAssembly_forImport.sh is a tool for compressing a Bionano de novo assembly output, and importing to IrysView and Bionano Access. "compressDeNovoAssembly_forImport.pdf" provides instructions for how to compress the results of the Bionano Genomics IrysSolve pipeline for de novo assembly. This script has not been fully validated and is currently not supported by Bionano.

compressHybridScaffold_forIrysView.sh is a tool for compressing a BioNano hybrid scaffold output generated by hybrid scaffold function in IrysView. The purpose of this tool is to facilitate the import of the IrysView hybrid scaffold output into the BioNano Access for visual display. It supports both automatic and manual run of hybrid scaffold output.

[compressHybridScaffold_forIrysView.pdf](https://github.com/bionanogenomics/AccessImportUtils/blob/master/compressHybridScaffold_forIrysView.pdf) and [compressDeNovo_forIrysView.pdf](https://github.com/bionanogenomics/AccessImportUtils/blob/master/compressDeNovo_forIrysView.pdf) in the repository provide detailed instructions on how to utilize these scripts.
